# Vector gallery

A small art-gallery SPA built with "plain" React and Typescript as a part of the course IT2810 Web development. The participants for the project were two others and I. The goals and learning objectives of the project were to learn the fundamental parts of React, as well as making a responsive web design. Some of the criteria of the project was to only use CSS3 and not to use any React component libraries. We were also supposed to demonstrate possible use cases for Web storage and React's Context API, as well as how to utilize external APIs.

To see a live demo, checkout [VektorGalleriet](https://vector-gallery.herokuapp.com)!

**Remark**
The app is partially in Norwegian.
